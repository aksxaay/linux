### Terminal things

I distinctly remember me having this particular command which runs say a man command and outputs it to a file so I can read it properly without any problems.

shows every possible command that can be run on the terminal \
`compgen -c`

in order to open something in vim you just have to do
`ls | vim -`
`man apropos | vim -`

```
compgen -flag
```
